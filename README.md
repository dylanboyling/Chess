# CLI Chess
This is a command line interface chess game coded in Java. It's adapted from a minimally viable chess program I created for a lab assignment at Algonquin College. 
I created this with the intention of furthering my understanding of OOP principles such as inheritance and polymorphism. 

Currently only move processing and move functionality for pawn and rook pieces have been implemented. 


## Features in progress

* Check, checkmate
* Pawn promotion
* Stalemate?

En passant and castling are not implemented. I may add them in the future if time permits it. 


## How to run my chess game

```sh
 git clone https://github.com/dylanboyling/Chess
 cd Chess
 javac PlayChess.java
 java PlayChess
```


## How to play

At the moment it is played between two human players one of whom will be randomy selected to go first.
Moves are entered by entering the coordinates of the piece you wish to move followed by the coordinates you wish to move it to.
e.g. 'a2 a4' to move the piece located at a2 to a4. 
Enter ? to display all legal moves you may make (WIP) and Q to quit.


## TODO add photos of gameplay later
