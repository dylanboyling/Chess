# CLI Chess
This is a command line interface chess game coded in Java. It's adapted from a minimally viable chess program I created for a lab assignment at Algonquin College. 
I created this with the intention of furthering my understand of OOP principles (inheritance and polymorphism). 

Currently only move processing and move functionality for pawn and rook pieces have been implemented. 


## Features in progress
* Move functionality for king, queen, bishop, and knight
* Alternate between players
* Check, checkmate
* Pawn promotion

En passant and castling are not implemented. I may add them in the future if time permits it. 


## How to run my chess game
```sh
 git clone https://github.com/dylanboyling/Chess
 cd Chess
 javac PlayChess.java
 java PlayChess
```


## TODO add photos of gameplay later
